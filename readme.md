fastpasstv_t3
-------------------------
A fork of bluetendes re-write of nixa's original fastpasstv plugin for XBMC. 

Fixed a bunch of indentation and whitespace issues. Also fixed some bugs with parsing the FastPassTV pages.

I would have just contribued to Bluetendes Google Code page, but it's being returning a 403 for the last couple of months, so I just decided to put my fixes on github.

I will say, if you think the code looks a bit funky (i.e. weird method names and the like), part of that is just XBMC plugins and the other part is just code that has changed hands over and over. I'll try to do a cleanup sometime in the next few weeks, but for now, back to watching TV on my AppleTV2 : )
